# Drawing-to-Face

***An implementation on the DeepFaceDrawing-Jittor from https://github.com/IGLICT/DeepFaceDrawing-Jittor, which generates face images from freehand sketches using the deep image-to-image translation. This repo mainly helps with creating the working environment worry-free using docker.***

### Before we start:

#### If you are just looking for a quick test-drawing with the application, make sure to check out http://www.geometrylearning.com/DeepFaceDrawing/, where the original author created a web-based testing interface (http://deepfacedrawing.geometrylearning.com/index_EN_621.html).

#### For the model specifics, please refer to the original paper: http://www.geometrylearning.com/paper/DeepFaceDrawing.pdf
