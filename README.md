### Before we start:

#### This REPO mainly helps with creating the working environment easily using docker. If you are just looking for a quick test-drawing with the application, make sure to check out http://www.geometrylearning.com/DeepFaceDrawing/, where the original author created a web-based testing interface (http://deepfacedrawing.geometrylearning.com/index_EN_621.html).

### Model Architecture:
